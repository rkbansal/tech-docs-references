## Tips for prompting
- Be detailed and specific
- Guide the model to think through it's answer
  - Tell in steps what to do:
    - Step 1: 5 fun, joyful words that relate to cats
    - Step 2: Rhyming names for a toy based on those words
    - Step 3: Add a fun, relavant emoji for each toy name

- Experiment and Iterate
  - No perfect prompt for every person or situation!
    - Instead, better to develop process for improving prompts through iteration
    - Idea -> Prompt -> LLM Response -> Idea -> ...

Prompting Process:
  - Be clear & specific in prompt (try with something simple first if not getting details in starting)
  - Think about why result is not giving desired output
  - Refine your prompt
  - Repeat
